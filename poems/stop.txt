alright stop
collaborate and listen
ice is back with a brand new invention
something
grabs a hold of me tightly
flowin like a harpoon
daily and nightly
will it ever stop? yo, I don't know.
turn off the lights and I'll glow.
to the extreme, i rock the mike like a vandal
light up the stage and wax a chump like a candle
